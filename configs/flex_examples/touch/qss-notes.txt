border-style

The style of all the border's edges.

This property is supported by QAbstractItemView subclasses,
QAbstractSpinBox subclasses, QCheckBox, QComboBox, QFrame, QGroupBox, QLabel,
QLineEdit, QMenu, QMenuBar, QPushButton, QRadioButton, QSplitter, QTextEdit,
and QToolTip.

If this property is not specified, it defaults to none.

Border Styles
dashed
dot-dash
dot-dot-dash
dotted
double
groove
inset
outset
ridge
solid
none

Warning: If you only set a background-color on a QPushButton, the background may
not appear unless you set the border property to some value. This is because, by
default, the QPushButton draws a native border which completely overlaps the
background-color.
